Be Best, bots: Melania Trump and tech CEOs discuss saturating US schools with AI
Melania Trump has turned her attention from her “Be Best” anti-bullying campaign to the nation’s best bots for tots.
The first lady welcomed some of the US’s foremost tech leaders – and a few bit players – to the East Wing of the White House on Thursday to inaugurate a taskforce on artificial intelligence and schools as part of an initiative dubbed the “Presidential AI Challenge”. The event concerned how to integrate AI into childhood education.
Joining Trump at a horseshoe-shaped table set in front of gold candelabras and American flags were various department heads, including the education secretary, Linda McMahon; Michael Kratsios, director of the office of science and technology policy; and David Sacks, the venture capitalist now serving as the White House’s cryptocurrency and AI czar. Tech CEOs seated with her included Google’s Sundar Pichai and IBM’s Arvind Krishna. OpenAI’s Sam Altman was spotted in the crowd but gave no remarks.

“It’s a beautiful event today,” Trump said as she kicked off the meeting. “We are living in a world of wonder.”
Trump took a moment to marvel at the advances of modern technology. She eschewed any dystopian visions of the future – or the present moment, when AI companies have been accused of fomenting teen mental illness and taking recent grads’ jobs.
“Cars now steer themselves through our cities, robots hold steady hands in the operating room and drones are defining the future of war,” she said. “The robots are here. Our future is no longer science fiction.”
The meeting was part of an all-day slate of events to promote Donald Trump’s AI initiative. Striking a far more bellicose tone compared with the first lady’s breathless wonder, the president’s initiative text states that the US is in a “race to achieve global dominance in artificial intelligence” and “under President Trump, our nation will win”. Along with the first lady’s AI challenge, which invites all students and K-12 educators to use and promote AI, the government’s initiative includes a series of executive orders aimed at fostering the technology.
McMahon said one of the Department of Education’s goals was to integrate AI into school curriculums across the country.
“It’s not one of those things to be afraid of,” McMahon said. “Let’s embrace it.”
Several tech-industry watchdogs criticized Melania Trump’s White House event, saying it was dangerous to promote a technology that had pushed youth to kill themselves and engage in disordered eating and other forms of risky behavior and self-harm. This comes as the Federal Trade Commission said Thursday that it was investigating OpenAI and other AI companies for the impact their chatbots have on children’s mental health.
“As public outrage against their lethal products continues to grow, big tech CEOs are seeking shelter behind President Trump, hoping to buy their way out of the many lawsuits and legislation coming to hold them accountable,” said Sacha Haworth, executive director of the Tech Oversight Project.
Tech companies pledge to bring AI to students nationwide

During the first lady’s afternoon meeting, she did not mention any of the harms AI has caused, but rather touted the technology, saying it would be the “greatest engine of progress in the history of the United States of America”.
The tech CEOs seated at the table also spoke, thanking the first lady for her work to bring artificial intelligence to children nationwide.
“It’s a real honor for me to be here,” said Google’s Pichai. “You’re really inspiring young people to use technology in extraordinary ways.”

Pichai said Google was imagining a future where every student “can learn anything in the world”. He said the company was actively working to set up systems to make AI more accessible in schools around the country. IBM’s Krishna said IBM was pledging to teach AI skills to 2 million workers in the US.
Cameron Wilson, the president of Code.org, who was also at the table, said his company would “engage 25 million learners” with artificial intelligence and that the company’s goal was to “transform our education system so students can thrive in AI”.
The White House said it had received more than 135 pledges from companies to support AI education in the US. Those include Microsoft, Amazon and other tech companies. Microsoft announced on Thursday that it was hosting free AI trainings and offering expanded access to its AI tools in schools. Amazon announced it was helping educators use AI.
‘This is corruption in the Rose Garden’

The day was scheduled to culminate with a dinner in the White House’s revamped Rose Garden, where Silicon Valley’s top luminaries were expected to be in attendance. Those included the Meta CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, Apple CEO, Tim Cook, Microsoft founder Bill Gates and OpenAI CEO Altman, according to an invitation list seen by the Hill.
Glaringly absent from the list was Elon Musk, who posted on X that he had been invited but “unfortunately could not attend”.
Haworth, from the Tech Oversight Project, contended: “This is corruption in the Rose Garden.”
The watchdog group Demand Progress said the day’s events showed how much power the tech industry now has in Washington DC.
“Honoring these self-serving, predatory executives in the first-ever event at the newly renovated Rose Garden is an obscene metaphor for who really runs this country,” said Emily Peterson-Cassin, policy director for Demand Progress. “If the administration’s top officials really cared about the people, they would stop these big tech execs from unleashing dangerously underdeveloped AI on us.”

### 从“力求最好”到“AI最好”：梅拉尼娅联手科技巨头，欲将AI全面引入美国校园

“力求最好”（Be Best）的反霸凌运动言犹在耳，美国前第一夫人梅拉尼娅·特朗普（Melania Trump）已将目光投向了下一代——以及服务于下一代的人工智能（AI）。

周四，白宫东翼迎来了一批美国顶尖的科技领袖。在金色的烛台与林立的美国国旗前，前第一夫人主持召开了一场特别工作组的启动会议，旨在推动一项名为“总统AI挑战赛”的倡议，核心议题只有一个：如何将人工智能融入儿童教育。

与梅拉尼娅同坐于马蹄形会议桌旁的，是包括教育部长琳达·麦克马洪（Linda McMahon）、白宫科技政策办公室主任迈克尔·克拉特西奥斯（Michael Kratsios），以及风险投资家、现任白宫加密货币与AI沙皇的大卫·萨克斯（David Sacks）在内的多位政府高官。科技界的座上宾则包括谷歌首席执行官桑达尔·皮查伊（Sundar Pichai）和IBM首席执行官阿尔温德·克里希纳（Arvind Krishna）。OpenAI的首席执行官萨姆·奥尔特曼（Sam Altman）也现身会场，但并未发言。

“今天这场活动意义非凡，”梅拉尼娅在开场白中说道，“我们正生活在一个充满奇迹的世界。”

她花了一些时间来赞叹现代科技的进步，刻意回避了任何关于未来的反乌托邦想象——也回避了AI公司正被指控加剧青少年心理疾病、抢走应届毕业生饭碗的当下。

“如今，汽车可以在城市中自动驾驶，机器人在手术室里稳定地操作，无人机正在定义未来战争的形态，”她说，“机器人已经来了。我们的未来不再是科幻小说。”

这场会议，是特朗普政府全天候推广其AI战略的一部分。然而，与其夫人的赞叹口吻截然不同，总统的计划充满了火药味。倡议文本宣称，美国正处于一场“争夺人工智能全球主导地位的竞赛”中，“在特朗普总统的领导下，我们的国家必将获胜”。除了前第一夫人发起的、邀请全美中小学师生使用和推广AI的挑战赛外，该倡议还包括一系列旨在扶持该技术的行政命令。

教育部长麦克马洪表示，教育部的目标之一，就是将AI全面整合到全国的学校课程中。“这没什么好怕的，”她说，“让我们拥抱它。”

然而，此举立即招致了多家科技行业监督组织的猛烈批评。他们指出，这项技术已将一些青少年推向自杀、饮食失调及其他危险行为和自残的深渊，推广它无异于玩火。就在同一天，美国联邦贸易委员会（FTC）宣布，正在就聊天机器人对儿童心理健康的影响，对OpenAI及其他AI公司展开调查。

“随着公众对他们致命产品的愤怒与日俱增，大型科技公司的CEO们正试图躲到特朗普总统身后，希望通过花钱消灾的方式，逃避即将到来的大量诉讼和法律制裁。”“科技监督项目”（Tech Oversight Project）的执行董事萨沙·霍沃思（Sacha Haworth）一针见血地指出。

在下午的会议中，梅拉尼娅对AI造成的种种伤害绝口不提，反而极力吹捧，称它将成为“美利坚合众国历史上最伟大的进步引擎”。

在座的科技CEO们也纷纷发言，感谢前第一夫人将AI带给全国儿童的努力。

“能来到这里，我深感荣幸，”谷歌的皮查伊说，“您正在激励年轻人以非凡的方式使用技术。”他表示，谷歌正设想一个未来，让每个学生都“能学到世界上的任何知识”，并已着手建立系统，让AI在校园中更易普及。IBM的克里希纳则承诺，将为美国200万名劳动者提供AI技能培训。

非营利组织Code.org的总裁卡梅伦·威尔逊（Cameron Wilson）也承诺，他的公司将“让2500万学习者接触到人工智能”，目标是“变革我们的教育系统，让学生在AI时代茁壮成长”。

白宫方面称，已收到超过135家公司的承诺，支持美国的AI教育，其中包括微软、亚马逊等科技巨头。

当天的活动，以一场在白宫全新修葺的玫瑰园举行的晚宴达到高潮。根据媒体看到的邀请名单，硅谷的顶尖人物预计都将出席，包括Meta的CEO马克·扎克伯格、苹果CEO蒂姆·库克、微软创始人比尔·盖茨以及OpenAI的CEO奥尔特曼。名单上一个显眼的缺席者是埃隆·马斯克，他在X上发帖称自己收到了邀请，但“遗憾无法出席”。

“科技监督项目”的霍沃思直斥：“这就是在玫瑰园里上演的腐败。”

另一家监督组织“要求进步”（Demand Progress）则表示，当天的活动淋漓尽致地展现了科技行业如今在华盛顿拥有的巨大权力。

该组织的政策总监艾米丽·彼得森-卡辛（Emily Peterson-Cassin）说：“在全新修葺的玫瑰园里，用有史以来的第一场活动来款待这些自私自利、如同掠食者般的高管，这是一个赤裸裸的隐喻，揭示了谁才是这个国家真正的主人。如果政府高官们真的关心民众，就应该阻止这些科技巨头向我们释放这些极其不成熟的危险AI。”
