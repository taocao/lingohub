The UK car industry is at a tipping point - can it be saved?

A gleaming white Vivaro van drove slowly off the production line at Vauxhall's factory in Luton, beeping its horn, while workers cheered and crowded around taking photographs.
Behind it, the production line came to a halt – forever.
The Luton plant began building cars in 1905. It kept operating for the next 120 years, taking time out to build tanks and aircraft engines during World War Two. But on 28 March, that came to an end.
The factory shut down, a victim of cutbacks at Vauxhall's parent company, Stellantis.
Justin Nicholls, a production shift manager, was one of the 1,100 workers there - he had worked at the plant for 38 years. "It was devastating, because it came out of the blue", he says. "It was a complete surprise."
It followed the closure of Honda's car factory in Swindon in 2021, and Ford's engine plant in Bridgend the year before.
Together, they have come to symbolise an apparent long-term decline in the UK motor industry.

In all, just 417,000 new cars and vans were built in the UK in the first six months of 2025, according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) - the lowest for that period since 1953.
Output for the year is expected to be around 755,000 vehicles — lower even than during the Covid-19 pandemic.
The SMMT's chief executive, Mike Hawes, described the situation as "depressing".
The sector contributes some £22bn a year to the economy, according to the SMMT, and as recently as 2023 automotive manufacturing employed some 198,000 people in the UK.
Andy Palmer, who was previously chief executive of Aston Martin, believes the ecosystem - and the sum it contributes to the economy - can only survive if the industry maintains its current scale.
"There is a critical mass of employment," he explains. "Once you go below that, you see it all fall apart.
"You don't have the university courses, you don't have people coming across from the aero industry, you don't have the pipeline of skilled engineers that allow the luxury firms to exist, and so on."
And the knock-on effect of this could affect regions already facing challenges.
"If we think about parts of the UK that have automotive plants, they're often disadvantaged regions," says David Bailey, professor of business economics at Birmingham Business School.
"Losing these good quality jobs would have a big impact in terms of wages for workers and also a knock-on effect in terms of the multiplier on the local economy."
He is concerned about what has already been lost. "I'd argue that actually we've let too much of this go already. I think once it's gone, it's really gone."
The question is, can the industry recover - or is it too late?
A concealed deeper problem

The UK car industry is sprawling. Alongside large factories run by the likes of JLR, Nissan, BMW MINI and Toyota, there is a network of suppliers and high-tech specialist engineering firms, along with a number of smaller, luxury car firms, such as Aston Martin, Bentley, Rolls-Royce and McLaren, plus bus and truck manufacturers.
In 2016, the UK produced 1.82m new vehicles – more than at any point since 1999. Yet even at that point, storm clouds were already gathering. And the industry has suffered further over the past decade.
Factory closures have had an impact, but other factors have been at play as well, including uncertainty over US trade policy, which has hit exports to a major market.
Then there was the role of Brexit.

One of the UK's leading manufacturers, Jaguar Land Rover (JLR), has deliberately moved upmarket in recent years, meaning it now sells fewer cars - also contributing to the lower figure of UK car production
"Obviously, Brexit had a big impact", says Santiago Arieu, senior autos research analyst at Fitch Solutions. "It created uncertainty and complicated future visibility."
As a result, experts say new investment suffered – just as the industry was gearing up for the massive changes being brought by the transition to electric vehicles.
The agreement with the EU to guarantee continued tariff-free trade soothed the industry's concerns when it came. But by then, there was another challenge to contend with.
The pandemic caused havoc within the industry globally.
In 2020, output dropped by nearly a third, hitting levels not seen since the mid-1980s. It also threw finely tuned global supply chains out of kilter and created shortages of vital parts.
Although demand for new cars was spiking, manufacturers simply couldn't build them quickly enough.

'Losing these good quality jobs would have a big impact in terms of wages for workers and also a knock-on effect in terms of the multiplier on the local economy,' says one expert
All of this caused short-term disruption - but the impact concealed a deeper, structural problem for the UK industry.
Quite simply, it has become an expensive place to build cars.
Part of this is to do with labour costs. Although lower than in some other Western European countries, particularly Germany, they are around twice the level seen in Central European nations such as Poland, Slovakia and Hungary.
Then, there are energy costs. British manufacturers currently pay some of the highest electricity prices in the world.
"Car makers operating in the UK also have factories in Europe and elsewhere, so it's not hard for them to find a replacement for their UK production," explains Felipe Munoz of JATO Dynamics.
The former chief executive of Stellantis, Carlos Tavares, has previously criticised the cost of manufacturing cars in the UK and northern Europe – while holding up the company's Kenitra factory in Morocco as a model of efficiency.
The investments starting to bear fruit

When the Luton plant shut last year, it was estimated by Luton Borough Council that the move could cost the regional economy £300m per year.
A small part of the workforce relocated to Stellantis' other UK plant, at Ellesmere Port in Cheshire, where the company is in the process of investing £50m in expanding production.
Of those who have not relocated, some retired. "[Others] are taking quite a reduction in pay", says Gary Reay, who was a representative of the Unite union at the plant.
The factory site has been bought by a property firm, Goodman - it plans to create more than 1,700 jobs at a new industrial park.
Mr Reay is unimpressed. "The problem for the workforce… is this is years down the road… It's too far away for most of our workers."

Yet there is hope in some quarters: it is possible this year's output may turn out to be a low point, as recent investments start to bear fruit.
In 2024, for example, Nissan stopped building its ageing electric Leaf model at its Sunderland plant — having previously been building about 30,000 a year. But it is due to begin making a new version this year and will start building an electric version of the Juke in 2026.
Nissan is also one of the manufacturers set to benefit from investments in gigafactories. Nissan's battery partner AESC is building one in Sunderland, which will be able to make power packs for 100,000 electric vehicles a year.
JLR's parent company, Tata, meanwhile, is investing in its own plant in Somerset, through its subsidiary Agratas.

The government says it wants to increase the number of cars and commercial vehicles built annually to 1.3m by 2035. The SMMT believes 803,000 vehicles will leave the production lines next year but bringing that up to 1.3m looks like a very tall order, according to Mike Hawes.
Greg McDonald, the CEO of Goodfish Group, is also circumspect. "I don't think many people think there's going to be a resurgence," he says.
His business makes injection moulded components for carmakers and has four sites across the UK. It also has a base in Slovakia.
"Suppliers like us are used to being constantly bid at for price and cost reductions, and there's a limit to how much you can do."
Diversifying or Chinese investment?

One way of mitigating this is for businesses to diversify - something more viable for smaller businesses in the sector.
Burnett's Manufacturing, based in Northampton, is one of many automotive suppliers clustered around the Midlands Corridor. A manufacturer of specialist rubber and plastic parts, it relies on the motor industry for about 40% of its business. But it also provides components for shipbuilders and oil and gas firms.
According to technical sales manager, Rich Dixon, smaller companies are more flexible and able to adapt to changing circumstances.
"I think we're lucky in some ways, because 60% of our business is diversified across many different industries," he says. "The last thing you want to be is 100% automotive.
"The difficulty is that higher up the food chain, there are some big companies that are very reliant on automotive."

Chinese giants such as Dongfeng want to expand their international operations
Some argue there is another way forward. Chinese giants such as Chery Group and Dongfeng want to expand their international operations – and see the transition to electric vehicles as an opportunity to do this in the European market.
"If you embrace the move to electric vehicles and become a leading light in attracting Chinese investment, then you can do what China did to us in the past, which is essentially use collaboration to rebuild your industry," argues Andy Palmer, who now owns and invests in clean energy companies.
This would, he adds, require significant government action, including negotiations with Beijing.
The question is, is it already too late?
One senior executive, who has spent decades in the European industry, doesn't believe the UK will become a major player in the EV market.
"I don't think governments have spent the necessary time and energy preparing for the shift to EVs.

"I don't see much opportunity for new players to come in," says the executive, who asked not to be named. "It's all about encouraging those who are already here to stay, and if possible to expand."
Another option, Felipe Munoz believes, is that the UK could double down on its position as a key player in the market for high-end cars.
This could mean becoming a hub for the production of luxury Chinese designs, while allowing cheaper mass-market models to be built elsewhere.
"I think people globally are willing to pay a premium for a British-made luxury car," adds Prof Bailey.
The Great British 'brain drain'

There is plenty at stake here, and it goes beyond the impact on local communities when factories are lost or suppliers stop trading.
"I also worry about it in terms of impacts on productivity, exports, and research and development," says Prof Bailey.
"Part of the reason why we've got poor productivity performance in the UK is that we have allowed too much manufacturing to go."
This is where we differ from our European counterparts, argues Steve Fowler, EV editor for The Independent. "We tend not to support our homegrown industries in the same way that other countries do".
What is harder to assess is the loss of national prestige. When MG Rover collapsed in 2005, there was an outcry, not just because thousands lost their jobs, but also because it was perceived as a symbol of the wider decline of British industry.
This became even more marked when MG – a classic British brand – became a boutique badge for cars made in China.

‘The UK is a great place to make cars, we have incredible expertise’
Many of the upmarket brands that still build cars in this country deliberately trade on their British identity. Think of Rolls Royce, Bentley, McLaren and Lotus. Even BMW-Mini, a mass market manufacturer, is more than willing to wave the Union Jack – or rather, have it painted on door mirrors and roofs.
If those cars were no longer built in Britain, it might well be perceived as a national humiliation. And for some, the decline of the auto industry would almost certainly be perceived as a symptom of a much wider loss.
"I do think people are [becoming] much more aware of where things are made," argues Mr Fowler. "This isn't necessarily a nationalistic thing, but more a sustainability thing. Do you want your car to have travelled halfway around the world to reach you?"
Ultimately, he says, there is already "a bit of a brain drain of talent, because the opportunities, bluntly, aren't here in the UK.
"[But] the UK is a great place to make cars, we have incredible expertise, we have some of the best engineers and people who can build them better than anybody else."

### 百年英国造车，已至危急存亡之秋

一辆崭新的白色沃克斯豪尔（Vauxhall）Vivaro货车，在工人们的欢呼与簇拥下，鸣着喇叭，缓缓驶下生产线。人们纷纷拿出手机，记录这历史性的瞬间。

在它身后，那条运转了120年的生产线，将永久归于沉寂。

这里是英国卢顿（Luton）。自1905年起，这座工厂便开始了汽车制造的漫长征程，即便是二战期间，也只是短暂转产坦克与飞机引擎。但在今年的3月28日，一切戛然而止。 作为母公司斯泰兰蒂斯（Stellantis）削减成本的牺牲品，工厂正式关闭。

贾斯汀·尼科尔斯（Justin Nicholls）是这里1100名员工之一，他在这家工厂工作了整整38年。“这一切就像晴天霹雳，”他说，“太突然了，我们毫无准备。”

这并非孤例。在此之前，本田于2021年关闭了斯温顿工厂，福特则在更早一年关闭了布里真德的发动机工厂。这一连串的关停，仿佛成了日不落帝国汽车工业江河日下的缩影。

英国汽车制造商和贸易商协会（SMMT）的数据令人心寒：2025年上半年，英国仅生产了41.7万辆新车和货车，这是自1953年以来同期的最低谷。 全年产量预计仅为75.5万辆，甚至比新冠疫情肆虐时还要惨淡。 SMMT的首席执行官麦克·霍斯（Mike Hawes）直言，此情此景令人“沮丧”。

要知道，这个行业每年为英国经济贡献约220亿英镑，就在2023年，仍雇佣着近20万名员工。

阿斯顿·马丁前首席执行官安迪·帕尔默（Andy Palmer）忧心忡忡地指出，整个汽车产业生态——包括它对经济的巨大贡献——必须维持在一定规模之上才能生存。“就业人口有一个‘临界点’，”他解释道，“一旦跌破这个点，整个体系就会分崩离析。大学里相关的课程会消失，航空业的人才不会再流向这里，豪华品牌赖以为继的熟练工程师储备也将枯竭。”

连锁反应将重创那些本就面临挑战的地区。“想想那些汽车厂所在的区域，它们往往是英国的欠发达地区，”伯明翰商学院的商业经济学教授大卫·贝利（David Bailey）说，“失去这些高质量的工作岗位，不仅会重创工人的收入，更会通过乘数效应，对地方经济造成毁灭性打击。”

覆水难收，是他最深的忧虑。“我认为我们已经失去太多了。一旦失去，就真的再也回不来了。”

那么问题是，英国汽车工业，还能挽狂澜于既倒吗？抑或，大势已去，为时已晚？

#### 冰山之下的深层危机

英国汽车工业的版图，远不止捷豹路虎（JLR）、日产、宝马MINI和丰田这些巨头。它的根基，是一个由无数供应商、高科技工程公司、以及阿斯顿·马丁、宾利、劳斯莱斯等一众小型豪华车企共同组成的庞大网络。

就在2016年，英国汽车年产量还曾达到182万辆，创下自1999年以来的新高。然而，彼时已是乌云压城。过去十年，整个行业遭受了接二连三的重创。

工厂关停固然是主因，但英国退欧（Brexit）带来的不确定性，也让投资者在电动化转型的关键当口望而却步。 随后，新冠疫情席卷全球，打乱了精密调整的供应链，导致产量在2020年暴跌近三分之一。

短期的混乱掩盖了一个更深层次的结构性问题：**在英国造车，实在太贵了。**

一方面是劳动力成本，虽低于德国等西欧国家，却几乎是波兰、斯洛伐克等中欧国家的两倍。另一方面，则是高昂的能源成本。英国制造商目前支付的电价，是全世界最高的之一。

“在英国设厂的汽车制造商，在欧洲和其他地方同样有工厂，要找到英国产线的替代品，对他们而言易如反掌。”JATO Dynamics的分析师费利佩·穆尼奥斯（Felipe Munoz）解释道。

#### 生机何在？多元化还是“师华长技”？

卢顿工厂的关闭，预计将给当地经济每年带来3亿英镑的损失。 尽管地产公司已买下地皮，计划兴建工业园创造新的就业，但这对于失业的工人们来说，终究是远水不解近渴。

然而，黑暗中也并非没有一丝曙光。随着近期投资项目逐渐开花结果，今年的惨淡产量或许将成为历史的谷底。

日产在桑德兰的工厂正在为新款电动车做准备。其电池合作伙伴AESC也在此地兴建一座能够满足年产10万辆电动车需求的超级工厂。捷豹路虎的母公司塔塔集团，同样在萨默塞特郡投资建设自己的电池工厂。

但要实现政府“到2035年年产130万辆汽车”的目标，依然是任重道远。

出路在何方？

对于供应链上的中小企业而言，“多元化”是一条求生之路。北安普顿的一家橡胶和塑料零件制造商，汽车业务占其营收的40%，但它同时也为造船厂和油气公司供货，以此分散风险。

而对于整个行业而言，一些有识之士则将目光投向了东方。奇瑞、东风等中国汽车巨头正积极拓展海外市场，并视电动化转型为进入欧洲的绝佳契机。

“如果我们能拥抱电动化的浪潮，积极吸引中国的投资，那么我们就能像中国过去对我们所做的那样，通过合作来重建自己的工业体系。”如今投身清洁能源领域的安迪·帕尔默建言。他认为，这需要英国政府拿出巨大的魄力，与北京展开谈判。

一位在欧洲汽车行业工作了数十年的高管则认为，英国可以另辟蹊径，巩固其在高端汽车市场的核心地位。“我认为，全世界的消费者，都愿意为一辆‘英国制造’的豪华汽车支付溢价。”伯明翰商学院的贝利教授也持相同观点。

#### 赌上国运的最后一战

这不仅是一场经济保卫战，更关乎国家的颜面与未来。

当年的名爵罗孚（MG Rover）破产，曾在全英引发轩然大波，人们哀悼的不仅是逝去的工作岗位，更是大英工业衰落的一个悲情符号。如今，当MG这个经典的英国品牌，变成了“中国制造”的代名词，这种感受愈发复杂。

劳斯莱斯、宾利、迈凯伦，甚至宝马旗下的MINI，这些仍在英国生产的品牌，无一不在刻意彰显其“英国身份”。车身上飘扬的米字旗，是它们最宝贵的无形资产。倘若有一天，这些汽车不再于英国本土制造，那将是难以承受的“国耻”。

“人才流失的迹象已经出现了，因为坦白说，英国本土的机会正在变少。”《独立报》的编辑史蒂夫·福勒说。

“但这片土地，依然是制造汽车的绝佳之地。我们拥有无与伦比的专业知识，有一批全世界最顶尖的工程师，他们能比任何人都造出更好的汽车。”

风雨飘摇的英国车坛，正站在命运的十字路口。是就此沉沦，还是绝地重生？这不仅考验着行业的韧性，更拷问着整个国家的远见与决心。
