What screen time really does to children's brains

The other day, while I was doing some household chores, I handed my youngest child his dad's iPad to keep him entertained. But after a while I suddenly felt uneasy: I wasn't keeping a close eye on how long he had spent using it or what he was looking at. So I told him it was time to stop.
A full-blown tantrum erupted. He kicked, he yelled, he clung to it and tried to push me away with the might of a furious under-five. Not my finest hour as a parent, admittedly, and his extreme reaction bothered me.
My older children are navigating social media, virtual reality and online gaming, and sometimes that concerns me too. I hear them tease each other about needing to "touch grass" – disconnect from the tech and get outdoors.
The late Steve Jobs, who was CEO of Apple when the firm released the iPad, famously didn't let his own children have them. Bill Gates has said he restricted his children's access to tech too.

Screen time has become synonymous with bad news, blamed for rises in depression in young people, behavioural problems and sleep deprivation. The renowned neuroscientist Baroness Susan Greenfield went as far as to say that internet use and computer games can harm the adolescent brain.
Back in 2013 she compared the negative effects of prolonged screen time to the early days of climate change: a significant shift that people weren't taking seriously.
Plenty of people are taking it more seriously now. But warnings about the dark side might not tell the full story.
An editorial in the British Medical Journal argued that Baroness Greenfield's claims around the brain were "not based on a fair scientific appraisal of the evidence… and are misleading to parents and the public at large".
Now, another group of UK scientists claim that concrete scientific evidence on the downsides of screens is lacking. So have we got it wrong when it comes to worrying about our children and curbing their access to tablets and smartphones?
Is it really as bad as it seems?

Pete Etchells, a psychology professor at Bath Spa University, is one of the academics in the group arguing that the evidence is lacking.
He has analysed hundreds of studies about screen time and mental health, along with large amounts of data about young people and their screen habits. In his book Unlocked: The Real Science of Screen Time, he argues that the science behind the headline-grabbing conclusions is a mixed bag and, in many cases, flawed.
"Concrete scientific evidence to back up stories about the terrible outcomes of screen time simply isn't there," he writes.

Concrete scientific evidence to back-up stories about the terrible outcomes of screen 'simply isn't there,' says one academic
Research published by the American Psychology Association in 2021 told a similar story.
The 14 authors, from various universities around the world, analysed 33 studies published between 2015 and 2019. Screen use including smartphones, social media and video games played "little role in mental health concerns", they found.
And while some studies have suggested blue light - such as that emitted by screens - makes it harder to drift off because it suppresses the hormone melatonin, a 2024 review of 11 studies from around the world found no overall evidence that screen light in the hour before bed makes it more difficult to sleep.
Problems with the science

One big problem is that most of the data on the subject of screen time relies heavily on "self-reporting", Prof Etchells points out. In other words, researchers simply ask young people how long they think they spent on their screens, and how they remember it making them feel.
He also argues there are millions of possible ways to interpret these large amounts of data. "We have to be careful about looking at correlation," he says.
He cites the example of a statistically significant rise in both ice cream sales and skin cancer symptoms during the summer. Both are related to warmer weather but not to each other: ice creams do not cause skin cancer.

He also recalls a research project inspired by a GP who noticed two things: first, they were having more conversations with young people about depression and anxiety, and second, lots of young people were using phones in waiting rooms.
"So we worked with the doctor, and we said, OK, let's test this, we can use data to try and understand this relationship," he explains.
While the two did correlate, there was a significant additional factor: how much time those who were depressed or anxious spent alone.
Ultimately, it was loneliness that was driving their mental health struggles, the study suggested, rather than screen time by itself.
Then there are the missing details about the nature of the screen time itself: the term is far too nebulous, argues Prof Etchells.
Was it uplifting screen time? Was it useful? Informative? Or was it "doomscrolling"? Was the young person alone or were they interacting online with friends?
Each factor generates a different experience.

One study by US and UK researchers looked at 11,500 brain scans of children aged 9 to 12 alongside health assessments and their own reported screen time use.
While patterns of screen use were linked to changes in how brain regions connect, the study found no evidence that screen time was linked to poor mental well-being or cognitive issues, even among those using screens for several hours of the day.
The study, which ran from 2016 to 2018, was supervised by Oxford University Professor Andrew Przybylski, who has studied the impact of video games and social media on mental health. His peer-reviewed studies indicate that both can, in fact, boost wellbeing rather than damage it.
Prof Etchells says: "If you think that screens do change brains for the worse, you would see that signal in a big data set like that. But you don't… so this idea that screens are changing brains in a consistently or enduringly bad way, that just doesn't seem to be the case."

'If our cognitive system was so fragile to changes in the environment, we wouldn't be here,' argues one expert
This view is echoed by Professor Chris Chambers, head of brain stimulation at Cardiff University, who is quoted in Prof Etchells' book as saying, "It would be obvious if there was a decline.
"It would be easy to look at the last, say, 15 years of research… If our cognitive system was so fragile to changes in the environment, we wouldn't be here.
"We'd have been selected for extinction a very long time ago."
'Terrible formula for mental health'

Neither Prof Przybylski nor Prof Etchells dispute the grave threat of certain online harms, such as grooming and exposure to explicit or harmful content. But both argue that the current debate around screen time is in danger of driving it further underground.
Prof Przybylski is concerned about arguments for limiting devices or even banning them - and believes that the more rigidly screen time is policed, the more of a "forbidden fruit" it could become.
More from InDepth

Many disagree. The UK campaign group Smartphone Free Childhood says 150,000 people have so far signed its pact to ban smartphones for children below the age of 14, and delay social media access until the age of 16.
When Jean Twenge, a professor of psychology from San Diego State University, began researching rising depression rates among US teenagers, she did not set out to prove that social media and smartphones were "terrible," she tells me. But she found it to be the only common denominator.
Today, she believes separating children and screens is a no-brainer, and is urging parents to keep children and smartphones apart for as long as possible.
"[Children's] brains are more developed and more mature at 16," she argues. "And the social environment at school and friend groups is much more stable at 16 than it is at 12."

Could limiting devices - or even banning them for certain age groups - make them more of a "forbidden fruit"?
While she does agree that the data gathered on young people's screen use is largely self-reported, she argues that this does not dilute the evidence.
One Danish study published in 2024 involved 181 children from 89 families. For two weeks, half of them were limited to three hours of screen time per week and asked to hand in their tablets and smartphones. It concluded that reducing screen media "positively affected psychological symptoms of children and adolescents" and enhanced "prosocial behaviour", although added that further research was needed.
And a UK study in which participants were asked to record time diaries of their screen time found that higher social media use aligned with higher reported feelings of depression in girls.
"You take that formula: More time online, usually alone with a screen; less time sleeping; less time with friends in person. That is a terrible formula for mental health," says Prof Twenge.
"I have no idea why that's controversial."
'Judgment among parents'

When Prof Etchells and I speak, it is via video chat. One of his children and his dog wander in and out. I ask whether screens are really re-wiring children's brains and he laughs, explaining that everything changes the brain: that's how humans learn.
But he is also clearly sympathetic towards parental fears about the potential harms.
It doesn't help parents that there is little clear guidance - and that the topic is fraught with bias and judgement.
Jenny Radesky, a paediatrician at the University of Michigan, summed this up when she spoke at the philanthropic Dana Foundation. There is "an increasingly judgmental discourse among parents," she argued.
"So much of what people are talking about does more to induce parental guilt, it seems, than to break down what the research can tell us," she said. "And that's a real problem."

Looking back, my youngest child's tantrum over the iPad alarmed me at the time - but on reflection I've experienced similar performances over non-screen related activities: like when he was playing hide and seek with his brothers and didn't want to get ready for bed.
Screen time comes up a lot in my conversations with other parents too. Some of us are stricter than others.
The official advice is currently inconsistent. Neither the US American Academy of Paediatrics nor the UK's Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health recommend any specific time limits for children.

The World Health Organization, meanwhile, suggests no screen time at all for children below the age of one, and no more than one hour per day for under-fours (although when you read the policy this is aimed at prioritising physical activity).
There is a bigger issue here in that there is simply not enough science to make a definitive recommendation, and this is dividing the scientific community - despite a strong societal push to limit children's access.
And without set guidelines, are we setting up an uneven playing field for children who are already tech-savvy by adulthood, and others who are not and are arguably more vulnerable as a result?
Either way, the stakes are high. If screens really are damaging children, it might be years before the science catches up and proves it. Or if it eventually concludes that it isn't, we would have wasted energy and money and, in the process, tried to keep children away from something that can also be extremely useful.
And, all the while, with screens becoming glasses, social media regrouping around smaller communities, and people using AI chatbots to help with homework or even for therapy - the tech that's already in our lives is rapidly evolving, whether or not we let our children access it.

### 屏幕之争：关于孩子大脑的真相，我们都搞错了吗？

前两天，我正忙着做家务，顺手就把我先生的iPad塞给了小儿子，好让他安靜一會兒。但没过多久，一阵不安涌上心头：我根本没留意他玩了多久，又在看些什么。于是，我走过去告诉他，时间到了。

一场惊天动地的“大战”就此爆发。他踢我、对我大吼大叫、死死抱住iPad，用尽一个不到五岁孩子的全部力气想把我推开。说实话，这估计不是我为⼈⽗母最高光的时刻，而他如此激烈的反应，也让我心烦意乱。

我的另外几个孩子，正在社交媒体、虚拟现实和网络游戏的浪潮中摸索前行，这同样让我忧心。我常听见他们互相调侃，说对方需要去“摸摸草”——意思是别老盯着屏幕了，该出门拥抱一下大自然了。

一个广为流传的故事是，当年亲手发布iPad的苹果公司首席执行官史蒂夫·乔布斯（Steve Jobs），却从不让自己的孩子玩iPad。比尔·盖茨（Bill Gates）也曾表示，他同样限制孩子们接触电子产品的时间。

“屏幕时间”这个词，几乎已经成了坏消息的代名词。年轻人抑郁率上升、行为问题、睡眠剥夺……统统都把矛头指向了它。知名神经科学家苏珊·格林菲尔德（Susan Greenfield）女男爵甚至断言，使用互联网和玩电脑游戏会损害青少年的大脑。早在2013年，她就将长时间使用屏幕的负面影响，比作早期的气候变化：一个人们尚未严肃对待的重大转变。

如今，严肃对待此事的人多了起来。但这些警告，或许并未揭示故事的全貌。

《英国医学杂志》（British Medical Journal）的一篇社论就曾反驳称，格林菲尔德女男爵关于大脑的论断“并非基于对证据的公正科学评估……且对家长和公众具有误导性”。

现在，另一批英国科学家更是直言，关于屏幕负面影响的确凿科学证据，其实相当匮乏。那么，我们对孩子的担忧，以及限制他们使用平板和手机的做法，是不是从一开始就搞错了？

#### 真相，有我们想的那么糟吗？

巴斯思巴大学的心理学教授皮特·埃切尔斯（Pete Etchells），正是认为“证据不足”的学者之一。

他分析了数百项关于屏幕时间与心理健康的研究，以及海量的年轻人屏幕使用习惯数据。在他的著作《解密：屏幕时间的真正科学》（Unlocked: The Real Science of Screen Time）中，他指出，那些博人眼球的结论背后的科学依据，其实良莠不齐，甚至在很多情况下存在缺陷。

“那些用以支撑‘屏幕时间带来可怕后果’的故事的确凿科学证据，根本就不存在。”他写道。

2021年，美国心理学协会发表的一项研究也得出了类似的结论。来自世界多所大学的14位作者，在分析了2015至2019年间发表的33项研究后发现，包括智能手机、社交媒体和视频游戏在内的屏幕使用，在心理健康问题中扮演的角色“微乎其微”。

甚至关于“蓝光影响睡眠”的说法也受到了挑战。尽管一些研究认为屏幕发出的蓝光会抑制褪黑激素分泌，从而干扰睡眠，但2024年一项对全球11项研究的综述发现，并无整体证据表明，睡前一小时看屏幕会让人更难入睡。

#### 科学研究的症结何在？

埃切尔斯教授指出，一个很大的问题是，关于屏幕时间的数据，绝大多数都依赖于“自我报告”。换言之，研究人员只是简单地询问年轻人，让他们回忆自己花了多长时间看屏幕，以及当时的感觉如何。

他还认为，面对海量数据，存在着无数种解读的可能性。“我们必须对‘相关性’保持警惕。”他说。他举了一个经典的例子：夏天里，冰淇淋销量和皮肤癌确诊数都会显著上升。这两者都和天气变暖有关，但彼此之间并无因果关系——冰淇淋并不会导致皮肤癌。

另一个关键问题是，我们对“屏幕时间”的性质知之甚少。这个词本身就过于笼统。

孩子看的屏幕内容，是令人振奋的吗？是有用的吗？是信息丰富的吗？还是在令人沮丧地“末日刷屏”（doomscrolling）？他是独自一人，还是在和朋友们线上互动？每一个变量，都会带来截然不同的体验。

牛津大学的安德鲁·普日比尔斯基（Andrew Przybylski）教授，曾主导过一项研究，分析了11500名9至12岁儿童的脑部扫描、健康评估以及他们自己报告的屏幕使用时间。结果发现，尽管屏幕使用模式与大脑区域连接方式的变化有关，但**没有证据表明屏幕时间与心理健康或认知问题有关**，即便对于那些每天使用数小时屏幕的孩子也是如此。

埃切尔斯教授表示：“如果你认为屏幕确实会让大脑变得更糟，那么在这样庞大的数据集中，你应该能看到这个信号。但你并没有看到……所以，那种认为屏幕正在以一种持续或持久的坏方式改变大脑的观点，似乎并不成立。”

#### “心理健康的毒药配方”

当然，无论是普日比尔斯基教授还是埃切尔斯教授，都从未否认网络世界中存在的真实威胁，例如网络诱骗、接触色情或有害内容等。

许多人对此深信不疑。英国的“无智能手机童年”运动组织称，已有15万人签署了他们的协议，承诺禁止14岁以下儿童使用智能手机，并将接触社交媒体的年龄推迟到16岁。

圣地亚哥州立大学的心理学教授珍·特温格（Jean Twenge）告诉我，当她开始研究美国青少年抑郁率上升的问题时，她并未预设社交媒体和智能手机是“罪魁祸首”。但研究到最后，她发现这是唯一的共同点。

如今，她坚信，将孩子与屏幕分开是理所当然的选择。“孩子们的⼤脑在16岁时会发育得更成熟，”她认为，“而且，相比12岁，16岁时在学校和朋友圈中的社交环境也要稳定得多。”

她提出了一个她认为毋庸置疑的“毒药配方”：**“更多时间独自对着屏幕；更少时间睡觉；更少时间与朋友面对面相处。这对心理健康而言，是一个糟糕透顶的配方。”**

“我真不明白，这有什么好争议的。”她说。

#### 骑虎难下的父母们

当我回过头去想小儿子的那次大发雷霆，当时的确让我心惊。但转念一想，在许多与屏幕无关的场景里，我也见过他上演类似的戏码，比如正和哥哥们玩捉迷藏，却被要求上床睡觉的时候。

官方的建议也莫衷一是。美国儿科学会和英国皇家儿科与儿童健康学院，都没有推荐任何具体的儿童屏幕使用时限。而世界卫生组织（WHO）则建议，一岁以下婴儿完全不要接触屏幕，四岁以下儿童每天不超过一小时（尽管其政策初衷是为了优先保证体育锻炼时间）。

这背后更大的问题是，我们根本没有足够的科学依据来给出一个明确的建议，这使得科学界本身也陷入了分裂——尽管整个社会都在大力推动限制儿童接触电子产品。

然而，无论我们是否让孩子接触，技术本身都在飞速演进：屏幕正在变成眼镜，社交媒体正向更小的社群演变，人们已经开始用人工智能聊天机器人来辅导作业，甚至进行心理治疗。

赌注很高。如果屏幕真的在伤害孩子，可能需要数年时间，科学才能最终证实这一点。而如果科学最终的结论是“无害”，那我们不仅浪费了大量的精力和金钱，还试图让孩子远离一个同样可以极度有用的工具。

这场屏幕之争，远未到尘埃落定的时候。
