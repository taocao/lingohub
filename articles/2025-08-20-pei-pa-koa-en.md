# A 400-year-old Chinese cough syrup is winning over Westerners

Young shoppers in particular are going gaga for Nin Jiom Pei Pa Koa  The recipe for Nin Jiom Pei Pa Koa has not changed since it was first
concocted in the 1600s. Yet the sweet Chinese cough syrup, which has the
colour and consistency of mud, is enjoying a renewed surge in popularity.
Sales rose by almost a third between 2019 and 2024, reaching 635m yuan
($88m) last year. Those coughing up for the syrup are not just in China, but
increasingly in the West, too.
Pei Pa Koa, as it is known, can now be found in more than 20 countries.
Bottles of the medicine, which includes ingredients such as loquat leaf and
pomelo peel, go for around $5 in pharmacies in Hong Kong, where it is mostly manufactured. But they fetch around three times that price when sold
through third parties on Amazon, an e-emporium, in America.
The enthusiasm has been particularly infectious among young people.
Worldwide Google searches for Pei Pa Koa rose by a quarter last year;
tutorials on how to administer it have racked up millions of views on
TikTok, a short-video app. Western celebrities have espoused Pei Pei Koa’s
benefits: Zayn Malik, a singer for One Direction, a now-disbanded pop
group, has praised the cough syrup’s ability to soothe scratchy vocal cords,
as have Cynthia Erivo and Jonathan Bailey, two actors in last year’s film
adaptation of the musical “Wicked”.
Traditional Chinese medicines have been steadily gaining interest in the
West, spurred on in part by the social-media craze for “biohacking”, which
focuses on improving health through experimental—and often spurious—
fads. Chugging herbal cough syrups is but one example (Pei Pei Koa is
unlikely to receive the blessing of America’s Food and Drug Administration
any time soon). Ancient Chinese healing techniques such as gua sha
(rubbing coloured rocks on your face) are also all the rage among young
Westerners, with social-media tutorials likewise accruing vast numbers of
views.
As for Pei Pa Koa, stubborn coughs are not its only enemy. In 2020 America
revoked Hong Kong’s special customs status, meaning products imported
from the territory are now subject to the same duties as those from the
mainland. Donald Trump’s tariffs on Chinese goods—including a 30% levy
that was extended for another 90 days on August 12th—will translate into
higher shelf prices for American fans of Pei Pei Koa. Herbal remedies are
particularly vulnerable to tariffs: many of the syrup’s ingredients come from
China and cannot be sourced elsewhere. There will be little relief for as long
as the trade war lasts.
