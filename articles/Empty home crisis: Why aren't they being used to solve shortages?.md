### Empty home crisis: Why aren't they being used to solve shortages?
A wide shot of closed off houses

England Data Unit, BBC News

In 1980, when Corina Poore, 36 years old and pregnant, first opened the door to a derelict house in New Cross Gate, south-east London, the estate agent refused to step in with her.
Inside were dead cats, dog excrement and filthy mattresses. Pigeons flew in through holes in the roof and there was no indoor toilet. The intense rotting smell was overwhelming.
Still, Corina decided this was her dream home. It was spacious, the £24,000 price was affordable and she was sure that everything was fixable.
After taking out a mortgage, she received a grant of £3,500 from Lewisham council, her local authority, which paid for fixing the ceiling.
"At that point, £3,500 was quite a healthy amount, which I desperately needed," recalls Corina.

Some 45 years on, her Victorian four-storey house is worth roughly £1m - something Corina, a semi-retired film and TV critic who got in touch through Your Voice, Your BBC News, could never have afforded otherwise.
However, times have changed.
Lewisham Council has continued to offer grants to the owners of empty homes for improvements - some for as much as £20,000 - but the uptake is low.
Just 22 grants were awarded in the borough in the last five years - despite it having 2,253 empty homes. A spokesperson for Lewisham Council said that, in addition to the grants, it is working "to make sure homes aren't allowed to remain empty or become derelict in our borough".
At present, however, 775 have been empty for longer than six months. Meanwhile, there is a national housing shortage, with rising homelessness and long social housing waiting lists.
As of October 2024, there were almost 720,000 empty homes in England, according to the government.

Bringing empty properties back into use could make up a chunk of the 1.5m homes that Labour wants to add to the housing stock
On the face of it, bringing these empty properties back into use would make up a significant chunk of the 1.5m homes that the Labour government wants to add to the country's housing stock by the end of its term.
But so far that isn't happening enough. The question is why, and given it could, in theory, be a sensible solution to two growing problems, is this a case of a missed opportunity - or is the issue more complex still?
Rising long-term empty homes

Not all empty homes are in the dire state of repair that Corina's once was. But roughly 265,000 of them in England have been vacant for longer than six months and are classified by the government as long-term empty (LTE). (Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland have different housing policies, as housing is a devolved matter in the UK.)
Fixing these would also have a significant effect on the communities around them, as long-term empty properties can attract anti-social behaviour and in some cases reduce an area's value.
Ann Devereaux, of St Werburgh's in Bristol, says that after the property next to her home fell vacant, it became a "magnet" for crime.
"It makes me feel scared when I leave my house or come in at night," she added.

The government has previously stepped in. The 2010-15 Coalition made funding available via two schemes: the Empty Homes Programme, which gave owners grants to fix their long-term empty homes; and the New Homes Bonus scheme, which rewarded councils that brought such properties back into use.
They appeared to have made an impact. Between 2010 and 2016, the overall number of empty homes dropped by 20% to 590,000, and crucially, long-term empty homes dropped by 33% to 200,000.
However, in 2016 the government then ended the Empty Homes Programme and lowered the rewards from the New Homes Bonus scheme - after which the issue became the sole responsibility of councils.
By 2024, the number of empty homes had crept back up by 22% and the number of LTEs had risen 32%.
A report by the charity Action on Empty Homes concluded it was "likely" that the end of the Coalition's scheme had been a factor behind this increase, alongside changing housing market conditions and economic uncertainty.
And once it was left up to local authorities to decide what to do about empty homes, the approach varied widely from place to place.
Councils got creative - but struggled to solve it

Currently there is no centralised information about the actions individual English councils have taken since 2016, so we contacted each one to ask about their approach.
In total, 77 of the 245 councils who responded to the BBC's freedom of information requests said they continued providing grants or loans. But in most cases, take-up was so low that it didn't prevent the number of long-term empty homes from rising.
A few councils even ended their financial assistance schemes because of this.
Corina Poore suggests that people may not realise such schemes even exist.
But Benjamin Radstone, a property developer who partners with the public to identify empty homes, says there is a range of reasons why owners don't take up offers and incentives around empty homes.
"People don't want to be pressured," he says. "They'll do it when they're ready to do it."
Other councils have had some success with schemes of their own. In Kent, a No Use Empty scheme offers interest-free loans for up to three years to owners who will let or sell the property afterwards.
Though it was set up 20 years ago with a relatively modest pot of £5m, today it is self-sustaining. Nearly 200 of these loans have been issued over the past five years.
Now the council wants to see the scheme expanded nationally. Last year a group of MPs, peers and housing campaigners wrote to housing minister Matthew Pennycook urging him to implement it nationwide.
Elsewhere in England, some councils have tried more creative solutions, such as connecting private investors with empty homeowners. Almost all councils charge premium council tax rates on long-term empty homes, which can be as much as 300% of standard council tax rates.
But Mr Radstone, who refurbishes empty homes through his company You Spot Property, argues, that this can "push people away from wanting to engage with the council".
Some also argue that this can disincentivise councils from addressing the root problem, as empty homes bring them more income through the premium tax rates.
"We're now in a position where councils are actually saying, 'Well, we're being rewarded for homes being left empty longer,'" says Adam Cliff, policy lead at the Empty Homes Network.

Councils do also have the power to take legal action against owners of empty homes, but this can be risky, time-consuming and costly.
And while loans and grants can be used to target about 10-20% of long-term empty homes, Mr Cliff estimates, you would need to make use of other processes to get the majority of them back into use, he says.
This was the experience of Kent County Council, which says only 18% of its LTEs that were brought back into use did so after interest-free loans were issued. In fact 61% did so after advice was offered to owners around the likes of tax and VAT, raising finance and planning.
"If a council has 2,000 empty homes," Mr Cliff says, "they need 2,000 different solutions."
A baffling conundrum

Part of the conundrum about there being a quarter of a million long-term empty homes is that this comes at a time when at least 354,000 people in England are believed to be homeless, and 1.33m households are on social housing waiting lists.
This is also a time when renters and buyers alike talk about a housing crisis in which soaring costs leave properties out of reach.
The Office for National Statistics' definition of affordability is homes selling for less than five times local earnings - which has not been the case on average nationally since 2002.
More homes on the market would help tackle this, too. So why has more not been done to solve, or at least better address, this contradiction?

The challenge is that there is no single reason for homes being empty.
One factor is the probate system, which can in some cases take several years, during which time the deceased person's house cannot be sold. Katie Watson from probate research firm Finders International, believes increasing staff numbers could help address a court backlog.
Then there is the issue that sometimes, councils are unable to track down the owners of empty homes. Jasmine Basran, head of policy and campaigns at homeless charity Crisis, believes there is a "lack of coherent data".
When the BBC approached English councils, the information we were provided about the condition and reason for homes being empty covered only around 13% of their LTE stock.
This means councils are "blind to their potential", argues Ms Basran.
The debate around premium tax rates

The experts we spoke to had their own view on the best solutions. For Mr Radstone, it is through offering tax relief to buyers, as well as ensuring that everyone who takes out a mortgage keeps an up-to-date will to prevent probate hold-ups.
Mr Grimshaw, meanwhile, argues that the funds gathered from the premium tax rates could be used by councils to start their own loan schemes.
But Mr Cliff argues councils without an empty homes strategy should not be allowed to charge premiums.
One thing most of those I spoke to were unanimous on, however, was that the government should establish a statutory duty for councils to address long-term empty homes - and force them to investigate and act.
The former Conservative government didn't introduce this - although in March 2024 it did allow councils to double council tax on empty properties after 12 months rather than two years.

The Labour government is yet to say if it will introduce a statutory duty, though Angela Rayner has promised councils more power over landlords
This was part of a "long-term plan for housing" to "help give local people the homes they need", then local government minister Simon Hoare said at the time.
We are yet to see if the new Labour government has taken the suggestion of a statutory duty on board in its housing strategy, although Housing Secretary Angela Rayner has said councils will be given more power to force landlords to rent out empty homes.
Meanwhile a spokesperson for the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said: "We are determined to fix the housing crisis we have inherited, and we know that having too many empty homes in an area can have a significant impact on local communities.
"That's why councils have strong powers to increase council tax on LTEs, and we will strengthen councils' powers to take over the management of empty homes, with further updates to be provided in due course."
More from InDepth

Back in south-east London, Corina Poore doesn't fully understand why the scheme that worked so well for her - and allowed her to become the homeowner of a £1m property - isn't doing the same today.
She believes it could still be a way of getting young people to make empty homes habitable too.
"When you're young you can do these things," says Corina. "[There are] people out there who would be prepared to do it.
"There are lots of houses that are nowhere near as bad as mine that probably just need a kitchen and a bathroom, and I think it should still be encouraged very vigorously."

### 英国空屋之困：72万套闲宅，为何难解住房燃眉之急？

1980年，36岁的科琳娜·普尔（Corina Poore）怀着身孕，在伦敦东南部的新十字门区，推开了一栋废弃房屋的大门。当时的景象，连房产中介都望而却步，不愿踏入半步。

屋里满是死猫、狗粪和肮脏的床垫，鸽子从屋顶的破洞里飞进飞出，连个室内厕所都没有，腐烂的恶臭几乎令人窒息。

然而，科琳娜却认定，这里就是她梦想中的家。房子够大，2.4万英镑的价格也还能承受，她坚信一切都能修好。

申请到抵押贷款后，她又从当地的刘易舍姆（Lewisham）政务会拿到了一笔3500英镑的修缮补助金，正好用来修补屋顶。“在当时，3500镑可不是一笔小数目，解了我的燃眉之急。”科琳娜回忆道。

45年后的今天，这栋维多利亚式的四层小楼，市值已高达约100万英镑——这是身为半退休影视评论员的科琳娜，当年无论如何也无法想象的财富。

然而，时移世易。

如今，刘易舍姆政务会仍在为空屋业主提供修缮补助，有些额度甚至高达2万英镑，但申请者寥寥。过去五年，该区有多达2253套空置房屋，却只发放了22笔补助金。政务会的发言人表示，他们正努力“确保房屋不会被长期闲置或废弃”，但现实是，目前仍有775套房屋的空置期超过了半年。

与此同时，整个英国正深陷住房短缺的泥潭：无家可归者人数不断攀升，公共住房的等候名单也越拉越长。

根据政府数据，截至2024年10月，仅英格兰地区就有近72万套空置房屋。从纸面上看，倘若能将这些闲宅重新利用，工党政府“在其任期内新增150万套住房”的目标，便能轻松实现一大块。

但这块“大蛋糕”至今仍无人问津。问题究竟出在哪里？这盘棋，理论上能一举解决两大社会顽疾，究竟是一个被错失的良机，还是背后另有盘根错节的隐情？

#### 越滚越多的“老大难”

并非所有空屋都像科琳娜的旧居那般破败不堪。但在英格兰，仍有约26.5万套房屋的空置期超过六个月，被政府归为“长期空置”（LTE）的类别。这些“老大难”不仅是资源的浪费，更会给周边社区带来麻烦，滋生犯罪，拉低整个区域的价值。

布里斯托尔市的安·德弗罗（Ann Devereaux）就深受其害。她家隔壁的房子空置后，很快就成了犯罪的“吸铁石”。“这让我晚上出门或者回家时，都感到提心吊胆。”她说道。

政府并非没有作为。2010至2015年的联合政府曾推出过两项计划：“空屋计划”，为业主提供修缮补助；“新屋奖励计划”，嘉奖那些成功盘活空屋的地方政务会。

政策一度立竿见影。从2010到2016年，英格兰的空屋总量下降了20%，降至59万套；而“长期空置”房屋更是锐减了33%，降至20万套。

然而好景不长，2016年，政府终止了“空屋计划”，并削减了“新屋奖励计划”的奖金，皮球被完全踢给了地方政务会。到了2024年，空屋总量悄然回升了22%，“长期空置”房屋则激增了32%。慈善机构“空屋行动”（Action on Empty Homes）的一份报告认为，政策的终结，加上房市环境变化和经济的不确定性，很可能是导致问题复燃的罪魁祸首。

#### 各显神通的地方政府，为何收效甚微？

一旦放权地方，各地对空屋问题的处理方式便五花八门。BBC通过信息公开请求，联系了英格兰的每一家地方政务会。在245个做出回应的机构中，有77个表示他们仍在提供补助或贷款，但绝大多数都因申请率过低，未能阻止长期空置房数量的上涨。

科琳娜认为，很多人可能压根就不知道有这类补助的存在。但专门与公众合作寻找空屋的房地产开发商本杰明·拉德斯通（Benjamin Radstone）则指出，业主不愿接受橄榄枝的原因多种多样。“人们不希望被催促，”他说，“他们想什么时候处理，就什么时候处理。”

当然，也有一些地方的创新取得了成功。肯特郡的“人尽其屋”（No Use Empty）计划，为那些承诺在修缮后出租或出售房产的业主提供长达三年的无息贷款。这个20年前仅有500万英镑启动资金的项目，如今已能自我维持，过去五年发放了近200笔贷款。

但贷款和补助终究是杯水车薪。肯特郡的经验表明，在其盘活的长期空置房中，只有18%是依靠无息贷款，而高达61%的成功案例，源于向业主提供了税务、融资、规划等方面的咨询建议。“如果一个政务会有2000套空屋，”空屋网络组织的政策负责人亚当·克里夫（Adam Cliff）说，“他们就需要2000种不同的解决方案。”

更具争议的是惩罚性措施。几乎所有政务会都对长期空置房征收高额的市政税，最高可达标准税率的300%。但拉德斯通认为，这反而会“让人们更不愿意与政府打交道”。克里夫则更进一步指出，这甚至可能让地方政府“躺着赚钱”，从而丧失解决问题的动力。“我们现在看到的情况是，有些政务会居然会说，‘房子空得越久，我们反而赚得越多’。”

#### 一个令人费解的悖论

一边是超过26万套房屋长期闲置，另一边，却是至少35.4万英格兰人无家可归，133万个家庭在公共住房的轮候名单上望眼欲穿。

这究竟是为什么？

问题的症结，恰恰在于其成因错综复杂，并非一言以蔽之。其中一个重要因素是遗产认证系统。在英国，一套房产的遗产处理程序有时会长达数年，期间房屋无法出售。此外，地方政务会时常无法追踪到空屋的业主，相关数据极度匮乏。无家可归者慈善机构Crisis的政策主管贾丝明·巴斯兰（Jasmine Basran）认为，这种“数据上的盲点”，让政务会对这些空屋的潜力视而不见。

大多数专家都一致认为，政府应当为地方政务会设立一项法定职责，强制他们对长期空置房屋进行调查并采取行动。

前保守党政府并未采纳这一建议。而新上任的工党政府是否会将其纳入住房战略，仍有待观察。不过，住房大臣安吉拉·雷纳（Angela Rayner）已承诺，将赋予地方政务会更大权力，以迫使房东将空置房屋出租。

回到伦敦东南部，科琳娜·普尔始终无法完全理解，为何当年那个让她成功置业、拥有一套百万英镑房产的德政，如今却失灵了。

她相信，这依然是能让年轻人将废屋变宝地的好办法。

“年轻的时候，你就有那股劲儿去做这些事，”科琳娜说，“现在外面肯定也有很多年轻人愿意这么干。有大把的房子，状况远没有我当年那栋那么糟，可能只需要装修一下厨房和卫生间就行了。我认为，政府仍然应该大力鼓励这种做法。”
