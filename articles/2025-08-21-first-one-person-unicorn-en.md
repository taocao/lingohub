# How AI could create the first one-person unicorn
## The technology is allowing entrepreneurs to start and grow businesses on their own

Sarah Gwilliam is neither a software engineer nor—by her own admission—
someone who “speaks AI”. But after her father died recently she got the
spark of an idea for creating a generative artificial-intelligence startup that
would help others like her handle their grief and sort out their late loved
ones’ affairs. Call it wedding planning for funerals.

Her firm, Solace, is still more of an early-stage startup than an established
business. But apart from herself, almost no human being is helping her build
it. She has joined an AI-powered incubator, called Audos, which decided
that her idea was promising. Its bots helped to set her up online and on
Instagram. If her idea works out, the incubator will not only provide capital;
its AI agents will support Ms Gwilliam with product development, sales,
marketing and back-office work, all in exchange for a royalty. She does not
need staff. In effect, AI helped her co-found the company. “I can’t tell you
how empowering it was,” she says.

As is its custom, Silicon Valley has already coined a neologism that
describes single founders like Ms Gwilliam: they are “solopreneurs”. In tech
circles, there are bets on which of them is likely to create the first single-
person unicorn—an unlisted firm worth more than $1bn. Some hope that
generative AI will make starting a business so cheap and hassle-free that
anyone will be able to become an entrepreneur much as anyone can become
a YouTuber—a breath of fresh air in America’s concentrated business
landscape. Whether people like Ms Gwilliam will be able to escape the
suffocating grip of the tech giants, however, is another matter.
Technological revolutions have a habit of shaking up the way firms do
business. The increased importance of machinery combined with the
expansion of transport networks in the late 19th century led to the rise of
giant corporations. Ronald Coase, a British economist, argued in his 1937
paper “The Nature of the Firm” that their existence was a testament to the
efficiency of consolidating and managing work within the confines of a
business, rather than outsourcing activities to the market. That, however,
began to change thanks to digital communication. Not only could companies
more easily outsource manufacturing and back-office jobs to low-cost
countries. They could also rely on internet platforms like Google for
marketing and Amazon Web Services for computing.

The rise of AI could well accelerate the trend, as semi-autonomous agents
provided by Silicon Valley enable firms to perform the same amount of work
with fewer employees. Henrik Werdelin, who co-founded Audos, says that
the rise of cloud computing helped him start several new businesses over the
past 20 years or so with little more than the swipe of a credit card to get
going. He describes AI as the next wave in that “democratisation”. “You
don’t need to code, you don’t need to be able to use Photoshop, because you
can get AI to help with that.” This, he hopes, will give rise to a flood of
startups built by people like Ms Gwilliam with no background in technology
but who have identified real problems to solve.

Another evangelist is Karim Lakhani of Harvard Business School. It now
offers a leadership course for executives in which they use generative AI to
build a snack-food company in 90 minutes, using the technology to perform
customer research, generate recipes, find suppliers and design packaging. In
a recent paper, Mr Lakhani and his co-authors presented a field trial in
which 776 professionals at Procter & Gamble, a consumer-goods company,
were asked to address a real business need either individually or in two-
person teams, with and without using generative-AI tools. It found that AI
significantly boosted performance, helping individuals with AI match the
performance of teams without it. AI proved to be more of a “teammate” than
a tool.

With the era of free money over, entrepreneurs are eager to find ways to
keep costs down. Peter Walker of Carta, which helps startups manage equity
ownership, says that founders used to boast about how many employees they
had. “Now it’s a badge of honour to say, ‘look how few people work for
me’.” According to Carta’s data, the typical period it takes founders to hire
their first employee after their startup incorporates has risen from less than
six months in 2022 to more than nine months in 2024 (see chart). Base44, an
AI coding startup, was recently sold to Wix, a web-development platform,
for $80m. It had just eight employees.

It is early days, of course. For one thing, AI agents are far from foolproof. In
June Anthropic, an AI lab, revealed the results of an experiment in which its
Claude Sonnet model operated a vending machine at the firm’s headquarters.
The bot’s goal was to avoid bankruptcy. It was good at identifying suppliers
and adapting to user requests (including hunting for a tungsten cube
mischievously requested by one employee). But it ignored lucrative
opportunities, hallucinated, offered too many discounts and ultimately failed
to make money.

Other forces may also get in the way of an AI-infused surge in
entrepreneurship. Despite the growth of the internet, social media, software-
as-a-service and cloud computing over recent decades, business formation in
America was anaemic until the pandemic—the result in part of an ageing
population. That demographic pressure will only intensify.

For all the promise of generative AI, it poses problems for entrepreneurs,
too. Annabelle Gawer of the University of Surrey notes that although the
technology lowers barriers to entry for new businesses, it also makes it
easier to quickly copy ideas. Unless a founder has unique expertise in their
domain, that may make it harder to sustain a competitive advantage.
Moreover, the provision of AI tools is dominated by tech giants and the labs
they invest in, such as OpenAI, backed by Microsoft, and Anthropic, backed
by Amazon and Google. Ms Gawer draws an analogy with the rise of cloud
computing in the 2010s, which those three tech giants dominate. Although
that infrastructure has made life easier for startups, it has also left them
dependent on the cloud triumvirate, which has been able to capture a good
share of the value these firms have generated. Last year the trio’s net profits
were equivalent to 7% of America’s total, up from 2% a decade before.
Another possibility is that the tech giants could pinch smaller companies’
best ideas. For now, Ms Gwilliam of Solace is sanguine. What she calls
“first-mover disadvantage” could be “a bummer”, but it could also validate
her idea. “Maybe they’ll come to me and say, ‘We want Solace.’ And then
I’ll be, like, ‘Great, sold!’” Just like a typical entrepreneur, then.
