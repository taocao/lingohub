Until this week, Angela Rayner was considered to be one of the most powerful women in Britain, a deputy prime minister who was widely tipped to be a future candidate for the top job in politics.
A self-described "proper working-class" woman, Rayner grew up in poverty and left school without any qualifications at 16.
She became the first female MP for the Greater Manchester seat of Ashton-under-Lyne in 2015, before entering high office in the wake of last year's landslide election victory
It was a remarkable journey.
But Rayner's extraordinary rise to the apex of British politics with the Labour Party has culminated in an equally spectacular fall.
The 45-year-old resigned as deputy prime minister and housing secretary after admitting she did not pay enough tax on the purchase of a new home.
She has also stepped down as deputy leader of the Labour Party.
It means a return to the backbenches for a high-profile MP who was considered to be a big political asset to her party and who remains a popular figure within many Labour circles and beyond.
Her against-the-odds story, personality, and ability to connect with parts of the electorate that might be less accessible to others, gave her a special status in Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer's cabinet and underscores why she will be so hard to replace.
Tough upbringing

Born Angela Bowen in Stockport, Greater Manchester, in 1980, Rayner grew up on one of the area's poorest council estates and from an early age, was caring for her mother, who had bipolar disorder and suffered from depression.
Both Rayner's parents were unemployed and speaking in 2017, she remembered having to grow up very quickly.
"My mum was a really vulnerable person. I remember, at 10, my mum being suicidal and me sleeping like a dog on the end of her bed, just to try and stay next to her so she didn't do any harm to herself," Rayner said.
She has also recalled going to her grandmother's flat on Sundays, so the family could take it in turns to have a bath there. Hot water was too expensive for them to use at home.

Rayner has often spoken about being told she would "never amount to anything", after she left school without any qualifications.
But after having her first child at 16, Rayner studied part-time at college, learning British sign language and gaining a vocational qualification in social care.
She spent a number of years as a care worker in Stockport, mainly looking after elderly people in their own homes, while also rising quickly through the ranks of the union, Unison.
She has described herself as "mouthy", someone who would "take no messing from management".

In her 20s, she became a full-time union official and eventually, after battles over working conditions and zero-hour contracts, rose to the most senior elected role in Unison in north-west England.
It was at Unison she met Mark Rayner, a fellow union official whom she married in 2010 and divorced in 2023. The couple went on to have two sons, one of whom was born so prematurely he is registered blind and has special educational needs.
At the age of 37, the mum-of-three became a grandmother, sparking the nickname "Grangela".
She credits the trade union movement with encouraging her to enter politics and taking her from - in her own words - "the girl on a council estate" to "a woman who feels like she can conquer the world".
Those ambitions started to be realised in 2015, when she was elected as the MP for Ashton-under-Lyne - a seat not far from her hometown. She later said she had only stood to make the point that "people like me can't get elected" and had "accidentally" won the seat.
The Prescott role

Rayner rose quickly in Westminster, taking up the women and equalities, and education briefs in the shadow cabinet of former Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn.
When Corbyn stood down in 2020, following Labour's worst general election result since 1935, Rayner did not run for the leadership, and backed her ally Rebecca Long-Bailey, who came second to Sir Keir.
Instead, Rayner stood for the deputy leadership and won election to that post comfortably - going on to be a central figure in Sir Keir's bid to remake the party.
But relations between Sir Keir and Rayner have sometimes been tense. After Labour lost control of eight English councils and lost the seat of Hartlepool in a parliamentary by-election in May 2021, the deputy leader was removed from her post as party chairwoman.
She pushed back and was appointed shadow first secretary of state among other titles.
By that point, Rayner had a strong support base and a powerful role likened to that of John Prescott, who was seen as a political bridge between the working class and the New Labour project during Tony Blair's premiership.
Rayner heavily leaned into that role and tried to use it to her party's advantage in the years before Labour's general election win in 2024.

Outspoken and combative at times, Rayner repeatedly accused the Conservatives of being "out of touch", and hammered the party with lines such as "one rule for them and another rule for us" during the scandal over pandemic parties in Downing Street.
Sometimes Rayner admitted she had gone too far, once apologising for describing senior Conservatives as "a bunch of scum".
Her prominence and the venom of her political attacks had put a target on her back and attracted unwanted headlines.
In 2021, Rayner lashed out at "sexism and misogyny" in politics, after a newspaper reported that she crossed and uncrossed her legs during prime minister's questions to distract Boris Johnson.
And in 2024, she was investigated by the police over the tax paid on the sale of her council house, again following a slew of reports by unfriendly newspapers, cheered on by the Conservatives. She was not found to have committed a criminal offence.

Her tendency to brush through political controversies gave her an air of untouchability, with some dubbing her "Teflon Ang".
Her stock had risen further still as deputy prime minister, leading on one of Labour's key pledges to build 1.5 million homes by 2030, and helping Sir Keir quell a rebellion by Labour MPs over welfare cuts.
But the political optics of a housing secretary admitting she had not paid enough tax on her home were not easy on the eye.
Rayner faced charges of hypocrisy and calls for her to stand down.
She resigned from government after the prime minister's ethics adviser Sir Laurie Magnus declared that she had breached the ministerial code.
While he said that Rayner had "acted with integrity", he told the prime minister that "she cannot be considered to have met the 'highest possible standards of proper conduct' as envisaged by the [ministerial] code."
In her resignation letter, Rayner said she deeply regretted her decision not to seek additional specialist tax advice when buying a flat in Hove, East Sussex.
In his handwritten response, the prime minister said he had "huge respect" for her achievements in politics, describing her as "the living embodiment of social mobility".
Losing a key figure blows a massive hole in Sir Keir's plan to relaunch the government after a difficult first 14 months in office.
It also marks the downfall of the career of one of Labour's brightest stars.
Having overcome a difficult upbringing and personal adversity to climb the heights of the Labour Party and become only its second ever deputy prime minister, Angela Rayner's political career has come to a premature end.

### “工党女战神”雷纳：从寒门崛起，却因房产税黯然落马

就在几天前，安吉拉·雷纳（Angela Rayner）还是全英最具权势的女性之一，一位被广泛看好有朝一日能问鼎首相宝座的副首相。

她出身“根正苗红的工人阶级”，在贫困中长大，16岁便辍学，没有任何文凭。2015年，她一举成为大曼彻斯特地区阿什顿安德莱恩选区的第一位女性国会议员，并在去年工党取得压倒性大选胜利后，昂首迈入权力中枢。

这本是一段非凡的旅程。

然而，这位工党（Labour Party）女将的非凡崛起，最终却以同样令人瞠目的方式，戛然而止。

这位45岁的政坛明星，因承认在一桩房产交易中未足额缴税，被迫辞去副首相兼住房大臣的职务，同时也卸下了工党副党魁的重担。

这意味着，这位曾经被视为党内巨大政治资产、在工党内外都广受欢迎的明星议员，将重返后排议员的席位。她的逆袭故事、鲜明个性，以及那种能与普通选民产生共鸣的独特亲和力，让她在首相基尔·斯塔默（Keir Starmer）爵士的内阁中地位特殊。她的离去，无疑留下了一个难以填补的空缺。

#### 坎坷的童年

1980年，安吉拉·雷纳出生于大曼彻斯特地区的斯托克波特。她在一个极其贫困的政府公屋区长大，从小就要担起照顾母亲的责任——她的母亲患有躁郁症，并饱受抑郁症的折磨。

雷纳的父母双双失业。她曾在2017年回忆道，那段经历让她不得不迅速长大。“我妈妈是个非常脆弱的人。我记得，10岁那年，她一度想要自杀，我就像小狗一样睡在她床脚，寸步不离，生怕她伤害自己。”

她还提起过，每到周日，全家人就要轮流去祖母的公寓洗澡，因为家里的热水费实在太过昂贵。

因为16岁就辍学，雷纳常常被人断言“这辈子不会有任何出息”。但命运的转机，也在16岁那年到来。生下第一个孩子后，她一边打零工，一边在大学里学习英国手语，并最终获得了一份社工专业的职业资格证书。

此后的数年间，她一直在斯托克波特担任护工，主要负责上门照料老人。与此同时，这位形容自己“能说会道”、“从不怵管理层”的年轻女性，在英国总工会（Unison）的阶梯上迅速攀升。

#### 从工会到国会

二十多岁时，她成为了一名全职的工会官员。在经历了一系列为改善工作条件、反对零时工合同的斗争后，她最终当选为工会在英格兰西北地区最高级别的民选领袖。

正是在工会，她遇到了同为工会官员的马克·雷纳（Mark Rayner）。两人于2010年结婚（2023年离异），育有两个儿子。其中一个儿子因早产导致双目失明，并有特殊教育需求。这位三个孩子的母亲，在37岁那年就当上了祖母，也因此得到了一个亲切的昵称“奶奶安吉”（Grangela）。

雷纳将自己步入政坛归功于工会的鼓励，用她自己的话说，是工会让她从“一个公屋女孩”，变成了“一个感觉自己能征服世界的女人”。

2015年，她的政治抱负开始成为现实。她成功当选为阿什顿安德莱恩选区的国会议员——一个离她家乡不远的地方。她后来说，自己当初参选只是为了证明“像我这样的人根本选不上”，结果却“一不小心”就赢了。

#### “普雷斯科特”式的角色

进入威斯敏斯特后，雷纳的仕途一路高歌猛进，在前工党领袖杰里米·科尔宾（Jeremy Corbyn）的影子内阁中，先后负责妇女与平等事务及教育事务。

2020年，在工党遭遇了自1935年以来最惨痛的选举失利后，科尔宾下台，雷纳并未竞逐领袖之位，而是选择支持盟友，最终辅佐斯塔默爵士当选。她自己则轻松赢得了副党魁的选举，成为了斯塔默重塑工党过程中的核心人物。

但首相与副手之间的关系，并非总是风平浪静。2021年5月，工党在一系列地方选举中受挫后，斯塔默一度解除了雷纳的党主席职务。但根基已稳的雷纳奋力反击，最终被任命为影子第一国务大臣等多个要职。

彼时，雷纳的角色，被比作托尼·布莱尔（Tony Blair）执政时期的约翰·普雷斯科特（John Prescott）——一座连接工人阶级与“新工党”政治蓝图的桥梁。雷纳也毫不讳言地拥抱了这个角色。

她言辞犀利，时而咄咄逼人，反复指责保守党“脱离群众”，并在“派对门”丑闻期间，用“他们一套规矩，我们另一套规矩”这样的金句，对执政党穷追猛打。当然，她偶尔也会承认自己言语过火，比如曾为将保守党高层斥为“一帮人渣”而道歉。

她的高调和攻击性，也让她成为了众矢之的。2021年，一家报纸报道称，她在议会提问时，通过交叉双腿来分散时任首相鲍里斯·约翰逊（Boris Johnson）的注意力。雷纳对此猛烈回击，痛斥政坛的“性别歧视和厌女症”。

她总能安然度过各种政治风波，一些人甚至给她取了个外号——“不粘锅安吉”（Teflon Ang）。

然而，压垮骆驼的最后一根稻草，还是来了。

作为住房大臣，却承认自己没有为房产交易足额缴税，这在政治观感上无论如何也说不过去。在伪善的指责和要求她下台的呼声中，首相的道德顾问洛里·马格努斯（Laurie Magnus）爵士宣布，雷纳违反了大臣守则。

尽管报告称雷纳“行事正直”，但结论是她“未能达到守则所期望的最高行为标准”。

在辞职信中，雷纳对自己当初没有寻求额外的税务专业建议深表悔恨。而首相在亲笔回信中则对她的政治成就表达了“巨大的敬意”，称她是“社会流动的活生生典范”。

失去这样一位关键人物，对斯塔捕手政府而言无疑是一个沉重打击。而对于安吉拉·雷纳本人，这位曾克服童年不幸与个人逆境，一路攀上工党权力之巅、成为英国史上第二位女副首相的政治明星，其职业生涯就这样戛然而止。
