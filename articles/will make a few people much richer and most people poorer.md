Computer scientist Geoffrey Hinton: ‘AI will make a few people much richer and most people poorer’
The ‘godfather of artificial intelligence’ on ‘the only hope’ for humanity, why China has an advantage — and when machines will outstrip us

I’m 10 minutes early but Geoffrey Hinton is already waiting in the vestibule of Richmond Station, an elegant gastropub in Toronto. The computer scientist — an AI pioneer and Nobel physics laureate — chose this spot because he once had lunch here with then Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.
We are led through what feels like a trendy wine bar with industrial interiors to a bustling back room already filled with diners. Hinton takes off his aged green Google Scientist backpack from his former workplace, which he uses as a cushion to sit upright, due to a chronic back injury.
Owl-like, with white hair tucked under the frames of his glasses, he peers down at me and asks what I studied at university. “Because you explain things differently if people have a science degree.” I don’t. Trudeau, at least, had “an understanding of calculus”.
Ever the professor, the so-called godfather of AI has become accustomed to explaining his life’s work, as it begins to creep into every corner of our lives. He has seen artificial intelligence seep out of academia — where he has spent practically all of his working life, including more than two decades at the University of Toronto — and into the mainstream, fuelled by tech companies flush with cash, eager to reach consumers and businesses.
Hinton won a Nobel Prize for “foundational discoveries and inventions” in the mid-1980s that enabled “machine learning with artificial neural networks”. This approach, loosely based on how the human brain works, has laid the groundwork for the powerful AI systems we have at our fingertips today.
Yet the advent of ChatGPT and the ensuing furore over AI development have made Hinton take pause, and turn from accelerating the technology to raising the alarm about its risks. During the past few years, as rapidly as the field has advanced, Hinton has become deeply pessimistic, pointing to its potential to inflict grave damage on humanity.

During our two-hour lunch, we cover a lot of ground: from nuclear threats (“A normal person assisted by AI will soon be able to build bioweapons and that is terrible. Imagine if an average person in the street could make a nuclear bomb”) to his own AI habits (it is “extremely useful”) and how the chatbot became an unlikely third wheel in his most recent break-up.
But first, Hinton launches into an enthusiastic mini-seminar on why artificial intelligence is an appropriate term: “By any definition of intelligence, AI is intelligent.” Registering the humanities graduate before him, he uses half a dozen different analogies to convince me that AI’s experience of reality is not so distinct from that of humans.
“It seems very obvious to me. If you talk to these things and ask them questions, it understands,” Hinton continues. “There’s very little doubt in the technical community that these things will get smarter.”
The waiter apologises for disturbing us. Hinton forgoes wine and opts for sparkling water over tap, “because the FT is paying”, and suggests the fixed-price menu. I select the gazpacho starter, followed by salmon. He orders the same without hesitation, laughing that he “would have preferred to have something different”.
Hinton’s legacy in the field is assured but there are some, even within the industry, who consider existing technology as being little more than a sophisticated tool. His former colleague and Turing Award prize co-winner Yann LeCun, for example, who is now chief AI scientist at Meta, believes that the large language models that underpin products such as ChatGPT are limited and unable to interact meaningfully with the physical world. For those sceptics, this generation of AI is incapable of human intelligence.
“We know very little about our own minds,” Hinton says, but with AI systems, “we make them, we build them . . . we have a level of understanding far higher than the human brain, because we know what every neuron is doing.” He speaks with conviction but acknowledges lots of unknowns. Throughout our conversation, he’s comfortable with extended pauses of thought, only to conclude, “I don’t know” or “no idea”.
Hinton was born in 1947 to an entomologist father and a school teacher mother in Wimbledon, in south-west London. At King’s College, Cambridge, he darted between various subjects before settling on experimental psychology for his undergraduate degree, turning to computer science in the early 1970s. He pursued neural networks despite their being disregarded and dismissed by the computer science community until breakthroughs in the 2010s, when Silicon Valley embraced the technique.
As we talk, it’s striking how different he appears from those now harnessing his work. Hinton enjoyed a life deep in academia, while Sam Altman dropped out of Stanford to focus on a start-up. Hinton is a socialist whose achievements were only recognised late in life; Mark Zuckerberg, a billionaire by 23, is very much not a socialist.
The noisy acoustics in the room as we sip our soup are a jarring contrast to a man speaking softly and thoughtfully about humanity’s survival. He makes a passionate pitch for how we might overcome some of the risks of modern AI systems, developed by “ambitious and competitive men” who envision AI becoming a personal assistant. That sounds benign enough, but not to Hinton.
There’s very little doubt in the technical community that these things will get smarter
“When the assistant is much smarter than you, how are you going to retain that power? There is only one example we know of a much more intelligent being controlled by a much less intelligent being, and that is a mother and baby . . . If babies couldn’t control their mothers, they would die.”
Hinton believes “the only hope” for humanity is engineering AI to become mothers to us, “because the mother is very concerned about the baby, preserving the life of the baby”, and its development. “That’s the kind of relationship we should be aiming for.”
“That can be the headline of your article,” he instructs with a smile, pointing his spoon at my notepad.
He tells me his former graduate student, Ilya Sutskever, approved of this “mother-baby” pitch. Sutskever, a leading AI researcher and co-founder of OpenAI, is now developing systems at his start-up, Safe Superintelligence, after leaving OpenAI following a failed attempt to oust chief executive Sam Altman. But Altman or Elon Musk are more likely to win the race, I wager. “Yep.” So who does he trust more of the two?
He takes a long pause, and then recalls a 2016 quote from Republican senator Lindsey Graham, when he was asked to choose between Donald Trump or Ted Cruz for presidential candidate: “It’s like being shot or poisoned.”
On that note, Hinton suggests moving to a quieter area, and I try to catch the eye of the waiters who are busy attending to the packed service. Before I do, he stands up abruptly and jokes, “I’ll go talk to them, I can tell them I was here with Trudeau.”
Once settled on bar stools by the door, we discuss timelines for when AI will become superintelligent, at which point it may possess the ability to outmanoeuvre humans. “A lot of scientists agree between five and 20 years, that’s the best bet.”

Although Hinton is realistic about his destiny — “I am 77 and the end is coming for me soon anyway” — many younger people might be depressed by this outlook; how can they stay positive?
“I’m tempted to say, ‘Why should they stay positive?’ Maybe they would do more if they weren’t so positive,” he says, answering my question with a question — a frequent habit.
“Suppose there was an alien invasion you could see with a telescope that would arrive in 10 years, would you be saying ‘How do we stay positive?’ No, you’d be saying, ‘How on earth are we going to deal with this?’ If staying positive means pretending it’s not going to happen, then people shouldn’t stay positive.”
Hinton is not hopeful about western government intervention and is critical of the US administration’s lack of appetite for regulating AI. The White House says it must act fast to develop the technology to beat China and protect democratic values. As it happens, Hinton has just returned from Shanghai, jet-lagged, following meetings with members of the politburo. They invited him to talk about “the existential threat of AI”.
“China takes it seriously. A lot of the politicians are engineers. They understand this in a way lawyers and salesmen don’t,” he adds. “For the existential threat, you only need one country to figure out how to deal with it, then they can tell the other countries.”
When the assistant is much smarter than you, how are you going to retain that power?
Can we trust China to preserve all human interests? “That is a secondary question. The survival of humanity is more important than it being nice. Can you trust America? Can you trust Mark Zuckerberg?”
The incentives for tech companies developing AI are now on the table, as is our medium-rare salmon, resting atop a sweetcorn velouté. As Hinton talks, he sweeps a slice of fish around his plate to soak up the sauce.
He has previously advocated for a pause in AI development and has signed multiple letters opposing OpenAI’s conversion into a for-profit company, a move Musk is attempting to block in an ongoing lawsuit.
Talk of the powers of AI is often described as pure hype used to boost the valuations of the start-ups developing it, but Hinton says the “narrative can be convenient for a tech company and still true”.
I’m curious to know if he uses much AI in his daily life. As it turns out, ChatGPT is the product of choice for Hinton, primarily “for research”, but also things such as asking how to fix his dryer. It has, however, featured in his recent break-up with his partner of several years.
“She got ChatGPT to tell me what a rat I was,” he says, admitting the move surprised him. “She got the chatbot to explain how awful my behaviour was and gave it to me. I didn’t think I had been a rat, so it didn’t make me feel too bad . . . I met somebody I liked more, you know how it goes.” He laughs, then adds: “Maybe you don’t!”
I resist the urge to dish the dirt on former flames, and instead mention that I just celebrated my first wedding anniversary. “Hopefully, this won’t be an issue for a while,” he responds, and we laugh.
Hinton eats at a much faster pace, so I am relieved when he receives a phone call from his sister and tells her he is having an interview “in a very noisy restaurant”. His sister lives in Tasmania (“she misses London”), his brother the south of France (“he misses London”), while Hinton lives in Toronto (and also misses London, of course).
“So I used the money I got from Google to buy a little house south of [Hampstead] Heath”, which his entire family, including his two children, adopted from Latin America, can visit.
Hinton’s Google money comes from selling a company in 2013, which he founded with Sutskever and another graduate student, Alex Krizhevsky, which had built an AI system that could recognise objects with human-level accuracy. They made $44mn, which Hinton wanted to split three ways, but his students insisted he take 40 per cent. They joined Google — where Hinton would stay for the next decade — following the deal.
His motivation to sell? To pay for the care of his son, who is neurodiverse, Hinton “figured he needed about $5mn . . . and I wasn’t going to get it from academia”. Crunching the numbers in his head, post tax, the money received from Google “slightly overshot” that goal.
He left the big tech company in 2023, giving an interview to the New York Times, warning of the dangers of the technology. Media outlets reported that he had quit to be more candid about AI risk.
“Every time I talk to journalists, I correct that misapprehension. But it never has any effect because it’s a good story,” he says. “I left because I was 75, I could no longer program as well as I used to, and there’s a lot of stuff on Netflix I haven’t had a chance to watch. I had worked very hard for 55 years, and I felt it was time to retire . . . And I thought, since I am leaving anyway, I could talk about the risks.”
Tech executives often paint a utopian picture of a future in which AI helps solve grand problems such as hunger, poverty and disease. Having lost two wives to cancer, Hinton is excited by the prospects for healthcare and education, which is dear to his heart, but not much else.
We are at a point in history where something amazing is happening, and it may be amazingly good, and it may be amazingly bad
“What’s actually going to happen is rich people are going to use AI to replace workers,” he says. “It’s going to create massive unemployment and a huge rise in profits. It will make a few people much richer and most people poorer. That’s not AI’s fault, that is the capitalist system.”
Altman and his peers have previously suggested introducing a universal basic income should the labour market become too small for the population, but that “won’t deal with human dignity”, because people get worth from their jobs, Hinton says. He admits missing his graduate students to bounce ideas off or ask questions of because “they are young and they understand things faster”. Now, he asks ChatGPT instead.
Does it lead to us becoming lazy and uncreative? Cognitive offloading is an idea currently being discussed, where users of AI tools delegate tasks without engaging in critical thinking or retaining the information retrieved. Time for an analogy.
“We wear clothes, and because we wear clothes, we are less hairy. We are more prone to die of cold, but only if we don’t have clothes”. Hinton thinks as long as we have access to helpful AI systems, it is a valuable tool.
He considers the dessert options and makes sure to order first this time: strawberries and cream. Which, coincidentally, is what I wanted. He asks for a cappuccino, and I get a cup of tea. “This is where we diverge.”
The cream is, in fact, slightly melted ice cream, which turns liquid as I lay out a scenario familiar in Silicon Valley, but sci-fi to most, where we live happily among “embodied AI” — or robots — and slowly become cyborgs ourselves, as we add artificial parts and chemicals to our bodies to prolong our lives.
“What’s wrong with that?” he asks. We lose a sense of ourselves and what it means to be human, I counter. “What’s so good about that?” he responds. I try to force the issue: It doesn’t necessarily have to be good, but we won’t have it any more, and that is extinction, isn’t it?
“Yep,” he says, pausing.
“We don’t know what is going to happen, we have no idea, and people who tell you what is going to happen are just being silly,” he adds. “We are at a point in history where something amazing is happening, and it may be amazingly good, and it may be amazingly bad. We can make guesses, but things aren’t going to stay like they are.”

FT：计算机科学家杰弗里·辛顿：“AI会让少数人更富，多数人更穷”
“人工智能教父”畅谈：人类的“唯一希望”，中国的优势，以及机器何时将超越我们

我提前了十分钟到，但杰弗里·辛顿（Geoffrey Hinton）已经等在了多伦多一家雅致的餐吧——里士满车站（Richmond Station）的门厅里。这位计算机科学家——人工智能领域的先驱、诺贝尔物理学奖得主——之所以选在这里，是因为他曾与加拿大总理贾斯汀·特鲁多（Justin Trudeau）在此共进午餐。

我们穿过一个充满工业风、感觉很潮的酒吧，来到一间嘈杂的后厅，里面已经坐满了食客。辛顿摘下他那只旧旧的绿色谷歌科学家背包——这是他之前工作单位的纪念品。因为慢性背伤，他需要用背包当坐垫，好让身体坐直。

他像猫头鹰一样，白发从眼镜框边探出来，低头看着我，问我大学学的是什么专业。“因为如果对方有科学学位，你解释事情的方式就会不一样。”我没有。而特鲁多，至少还“懂点微积分”。

这位被誉为“人工智能教父”的学者，如今已习惯于向世人解释他毕生的心血，因为这项技术正开始渗透到我们生活的每个角落。他见证了人工智能如何从学术圈——他几乎整个职业生涯都在那里度过，包括在多伦多大学的二十多年——走向主流，被那些手握重金、渴望触达消费者和企业的科技公司推向风口浪尖。

辛顿因在20世纪80年代中期的“基础性发现与发明”而获得诺贝尔奖，这些成果促成了“基于人工神经网络的机器学习”。这种大致模仿人脑工作方式的方法，为我们今天触手可及的强大人工智能系统奠定了基础。

然而，ChatGPT的问世以及随之而来的人工智能开发热潮，让辛顿停下了脚步。他从一个技术的加速者，转变为一个对其风险大声疾呼的警示者。在过去的几年里，随着该领域的飞速发展，辛顿变得极度悲观，他指出人工智能有可能对人类造成严重伤害。

在两个小时的午餐中，我们谈论了许多话题：从核威胁（“一个普通人在AI的帮助下很快就能制造出生物武器，这太可怕了。想象一下，如果街上的普通人都能制造核弹会怎样”）到他自己使用AI的习惯（它“非常有用”），再到聊天机器人如何在他最近的分手中意外地成了“第三者”。

“这对我来说显而易见。你和这些东西交谈，问它们问题，它能理解，”辛顿继续说道。“技术圈里几乎没人怀疑这些东西会变得更聪明。”

辛顿在该领域的泰斗地位毋庸置疑，但也有人，甚至包括业内人士，认为现有技术不过是一种复杂的工具。例如，他的前同事、图灵奖共同得主杨立昆（Yann LeCun）——现任Meta首席人工智能科学家——就认为，支撑ChatGPT等产品的大语言模型（Large Language Models, LLM）能力有限，无法与物理世界进行有意义的互动。对于这些怀疑论者来说，这一代人工智能还无法达到人类的智能水平。

辛顿说：“我们对自己的心智知之甚少。”但对于人工智能系统，“是我们创造了它们，构建了它们……我们的理解水平远超对人脑的理解，因为我们知道每个神经元在做什么。”他说话时充满信心，但也承认存在许多未知。在整个谈话过程中，他很坦然地陷入长时间的思考，然后得出结论：“我不知道”或“没头绪”。

辛顿于1947年出生在伦敦西南部的温布尔登，父亲是昆虫学家，母亲是学校教师。在剑桥大学国王学院，他辗转于多个学科，最终选择了实验心理学作为本科学位，并在20世纪70年代初转向计算机科学。尽管神经网络（neural networks）曾被计算机科学界轻视和摒弃，但他始终坚持研究，直到2010年代取得突破，硅谷才开始拥抱这项技术。

当我们喝着汤时，房间里嘈杂的声响，与这位轻声细语、深思熟虑地谈论人类生存问题的长者形成了鲜明对比。他激情澎湃地提出了一个方案，来应对那些由“雄心勃勃、争强好胜的男人们”开发的现代人工智能系统所带来的风险。这些人设想人工智能成为个人助理。这听起来似乎无伤大雅，但辛顿不这么认为。

“当助理比你聪明得多的时候，你如何保住自己的权力？我们只知道一个例子，那就是一个智慧得多的生物被一个智慧得少的生物所控制，那就是母亲和婴儿……如果婴儿无法控制母亲，他们就会死掉。”

辛顿认为，人类“唯一的希望”是把人工智能设计成我们的母亲，“因为母亲非常关心孩子，会保护孩子的生命”和成长。“这才是我们应该追求的关系。”

“这可以作为你文章的标题，”他笑着说，用勺子指了指我的记事本。

他告诉我，他以前的研究生伊利亞·蘇茲克維（Ilya Sutskever）也认同这个“母婴”方案。蘇茲克維是顶尖的人工智能研究员，也是OpenAI的联合创始人。在试图罢免首席执行官萨姆·奥尔特曼（Sam Altman）失败并离开OpenAI后，他现在正在自己的初创公司Safe Superintelligence开发新系统。但我猜测，奥尔特曼或埃隆·马斯克（Elon Musk）更有可能赢得这场竞赛。“是的。”那你更信任他们中的哪一个？

他停顿了很久，然后回忆起2016年共和党参议员林赛·格雷厄姆（Lindsey Graham）被问及在唐纳德·特朗普（Donald Trump）和特德·克鲁兹（Ted Cruz）之间选择总统候选人时的一句话：“这就像是被枪杀还是被毒死。”

说到这里，辛顿建议换个安静点的地方。我试图吸引忙碌的服务员的注意，但没成功。他却突然站起来开玩笑说：“我去跟他们说，我可以说我跟特鲁多一起来过这儿。”

换到门口的吧台高脚凳上坐定后，我们讨论了人工智能何时会达到超级智能（superintelligent）——届时它可能拥有超越人类的谋略。“很多科学家都认为在5到20年之间，这是最靠谱的猜测。”

虽然辛顿对自己的命运很坦然——“我已经77岁了，反正也快到头了”——但许多年轻人可能会对这种前景感到沮丧；他们该如何保持积极？

“我真想说，‘他们为什么要保持积极？’也许如果他们不那么积极，反而会做得更多，”他用一个问题回答了我的问题——这是他惯常的习惯。

“假设你用望远镜看到一场外星人入侵，10年后就会抵达地球，你会说‘我们如何保持积极？’吗？不，你会说，‘我们到底该怎么应对？’如果保持积极意味着假装这一切不会发生，那人们就不应该保持积极。”

辛顿对西方政府的干预不抱希望，并批评美国政府缺乏监管人工智能的意愿。白宫称必须迅速行动，发展技术以击败中国并保护民主价值观。巧的是，辛顿刚刚从上海回来，还倒着时差。他在那里与一些政治局成员开了会。他们邀请他去谈论“人工智能的生存威胁”。

“中国很重视这件事。很多政界人士都是工程师出身。他们理解这个问题的深度，是律师和销售员无法比拟的，”他补充道。“对于生存威胁，只要有一个国家想出应对办法，就可以告诉其他国家。”

我们能相信中国会维护全人类的利益吗？“这是次要问题。人类的生存比过得舒不舒服更重要。你能相信美国吗？你能相信马克·扎克伯格（Mark Zuckerberg）吗？”

随着我们的中等熟度三文鱼端上桌，卧在甜玉米浓汤上，科技公司开发人工智能的动机也被摆上了台面。辛顿一边说，一边用一片鱼肉蘸着盘里的酱汁。

他之前曾主张暂停人工智能开发，并签署了多封信件，反对OpenAI转型为营利性公司——马斯克正试图在一场进行中的诉讼中阻止这一举动。

谈论人工智能的力量常常被说成是纯粹的炒作，目的是为了抬高开发它的初创公司的估值，但辛顿说，“一个说法可以既对科技公司有利，又同时是事实”。

我很好奇他在日常生活中是否经常使用人工智能。原来，ChatGPT是辛顿的首选产品，主要用于“研究”，但也用来做一些诸如询问如何修理烘干机之类的事情。然而，它甚至还出现在他最近与交往多年的伴侣分手的故事里。

“她让ChatGPT告诉我，我就是个渣男，”他说，并承认此举让他很惊讶。“她让聊天机器人解释我的行为有多恶劣，然后把内容给了我。我并不觉得自己是渣男，所以这并没有让我感觉太糟……我遇到了一个我更喜欢的人，你知道的，事情就是这样。”他笑了，然后补充道：“也许你不知道！”

我忍住了八卦前任的冲动，转而提到我刚庆祝了我的第一个结婚纪念日。“希望这暂时不会成为你的问题，”他回答道，我们都笑了起来。

**辛顿吃饭的速度快得多，**所以当他接到姐姐的电话时，我松了一口气。他告诉姐姐自己正在“一家非常嘈杂的餐厅”接受采访。他的姐姐住在塔斯马尼亚（“她想念伦敦”），哥哥住在法国南部（“他也想念伦敦”），而辛顿自己住在多伦多（当然，也想念伦敦）。

“所以我用从谷歌拿到的钱，在汉普斯特德西斯公园（Hampstead Heath）南边买了一座小房子”，这样他全家，包括他从拉丁美洲领养的两个孩子，都可以去住。

辛顿的谷歌钱来自于2013年卖掉的一家公司。这家公司是他和蘇茲克維以及另一位研究生亚历克斯·克里热夫斯基（Alex Krizhevsky）共同创办的，他们构建了一个能以人类水平的准确度识别物体的AI系统。他们卖了4400万美元，辛顿本想三人平分，但他的学生们坚持让他拿40%。交易完成后，他们加入了谷歌——辛顿在那里工作了十年。

他卖公司的动机是什么？为了支付他患有神经多样性（neurodiverse）的儿子的护理费用。辛顿“估算他大概需要500万美元……而我从学术界是拿不到这笔钱的”。他在脑子里算了算，税后从谷歌拿到的钱“略微超出了”这个目标。

他于2023年离开了这家科技巨头，并在接受《纽约时报》采访时警告了该技术的危险。媒体报道称，他辞职是为了能更坦率地谈论人工智能的风险。

“每次我和记者交谈，我都会纠正这个误解。但这从没什么效果，因为那个故事太吸引人了，”他说。“我离开是因为我75岁了，我的编程能力不如从前了，而且Netflix上还有一大堆我没来得及看的东西。我已经非常努力地工作了55年，我觉得是时候退休了……而且我想，既然我都要走了，我正好可以谈谈那些风险。”

科技高管们常常描绘一幅乌托邦式的未来图景，人工智能将帮助解决饥饿、贫困和疾病等宏大问题。辛顿曾因癌症失去了两位妻子，他对医疗保健和教育的前景感到兴奋——教育是他非常关心的领域，但对其他方面则不然。

“实际会发生的是，富人将使用人工智能来取代工人，”他说。“这将造成大规模失业和利润的急剧增长。它会让少数人变得更富，而大多数人变得更穷。这不是人工智能的错，这是资本主义制度的错。”

奥尔特曼和他的同行们曾建议，如果劳动力市场对人口来说变得太小，可以引入全民基本收入（universal basic income），但这“无法解决人的尊严问题”，因为人们从工作中获得价值感，辛顿说。他承认想念他的研究生们，可以和他们碰撞想法或向他们提问，因为“他们年轻，理解事物更快”。现在，他转而问ChatGPT。

这会导致我们变得懒惰和缺乏创造力吗？认知外包（Cognitive offloading）是目前正在讨论的一个概念，即人工智能工具的用户将任务委托出去，而没有进行批判性思考或记住检索到的信息。又到了打比方的时候了。

“我们穿衣服，因为穿衣服，我们的毛发就变少了。我们更容易因寒冷而死，但前提是我们没有衣服穿”。辛顿认为，只要我们能接触到有用的人工智能系统，它就是一个有价值的工具。

他看了看甜点选项，并确保这次自己先点：草莓配奶油。巧的是，这也是我想要的。他要了一杯卡布奇诺，我要了一杯茶。“这是我们产生分歧的地方。”

奶油实际上是微微融化的冰淇淋，在我描述一个在硅谷司空见惯，但对大多数人来说如同科幻的场景时，它正慢慢变成液体：我们幸福地生活在“具身AI”（embodied AI）——也就是机器人——中间，并随着我们将人造部件和化学物质添加到身体中以延长生命，而慢慢变成赛博格（cyborgs）。

“那有什么问题吗？”他问。我们会失去自我意识和作为人的意义，我反驳道。“那又有什么好的呢？”他回应道。我试图追问：这不一定非得是好的，但我们将不再拥有它，那就是灭绝，不是吗？

“是的，”他说，停顿了一下。

“我们不知道将会发生什么，我们毫无头绪，那些告诉你将会发生什么的人只是在犯傻，”他补充道。“我们正处于历史的一个节点，一些惊人的事情正在发生，它可能好得惊人，也可能坏得惊人。我们可以猜测，但事情不会一成不变。”
